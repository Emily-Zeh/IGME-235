#Game Treatment

##Concept
Deer With It is a simple 2D platformer game where the player controls a deer looking for a flower to eat while 
avoiding the hunters' arrows.

##Genre
The game will be a simple 2D platformer with a few different level layouts.

##Platform
This game will be desktop only, but could be easily modified to work on mobile.

##Story
In this game, the player is controlling a little deer who is out looking for lunch. However, it its the middle of hunting season, 
and the deer must dodge all the arrows on his way to find a tasty snack.

##Esthetics
The game will use a cartoony art style and have looping background music. Simple sound effects will play when the player 
reaches a flower or is hit by an arrow.

##Gameplay
The player will use the left and right arrow keys to move from side to side, and the spacebar to jump. The level will reset 
each time a flower is reached. There will be an instructions scene, but the controls should be pretty intuitive. 
The player must learn the best way to make it to the flowers without getting shot by the arrows.

##Screenshots
There will be pictures here later ;)
